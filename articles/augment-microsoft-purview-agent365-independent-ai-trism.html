    <p>
      At Microsoft Ignite 2025, Microsoft made a decisive statement:
      <strong>AI agents are no longer experimental tools — they are enterprise actors that require identity, governance, and security controls.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      With major announcements across Agent 365, Entra Agent ID, expanded Microsoft Purview,
      and AI-assisted security operations, Microsoft is constructing a native control plane
      for AI agents operating across Microsoft 365, Copilot, Fabric, and Foundry.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a meaningful and necessary evolution. However, as enterprises deploy AI across
      multiple clouds, data platforms, and third-party tools, a critical reality emerges:
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Native, vendor-scoped controls alone are not sufficient for enterprise-wide AI trust, risk, and security management.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">What Microsoft Got Right</h2>

    <h2 class="section-title">Agent 365: Centralized Oversight for AI Agents</h2>

    <p>
      Agent 365 introduces a centralized lifecycle and management plane for AI agents,
      treating them as digital employees rather than disposable tools.
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Agent registration and inventory</li>
      <li>Lifecycle and access management</li>
      <li>Integration with Entra, Defender, Purview, and Sentinel</li>
      <li>Governance embedded into agent build workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Embedding governance at the point of agent creation aligns operational controls
      with developer workflows rather than retrofitting security after deployment.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Entra Agent ID: Identity for Non-Human Actors</h2>

    <p>
      Entra Agent ID extends Zero Trust identity concepts to AI agents by enabling
      unique identities, authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Identity is foundational. Without it, governance cannot scale.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Expanded Microsoft Purview for AI</h2>

    <p>
      Microsoft Purview remains a core pillar of AI data governance, offering:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Real-time DLP for Copilot prompts and responses</li>
      <li>DSPM-driven understanding of data exposure</li>
      <li>Integration with Insider Risk Management</li>
      <li>AI-assisted investigation and triage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Where the Gaps Remain</h2>

    <h2 class="section-title">Deep Protections Depend on Entra Registration</h2>

    <p>
      The most advanced auditing and enforcement capabilities apply only to agents
      registered with Entra Agent ID.
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Registration is opt-in</li>
      <li>Unregistered agents receive limited visibility</li>
      <li>Shadow and rogue agents can operate with reduced oversight</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Preventative Controls Remain in Preview</h2>

    <p>
      Several critical AI security capabilities remain in Preview, including:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Shadow AI agent detection</li>
      <li>TLS traffic inspection</li>
      <li>Network-layer prompt injection protection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Understanding the Insider Threat Vectors</h2>

    <h2 class="section-title">Global Secure Access (GSA) Client Bypass</h2>

    <p>
      The GSA client enforces Zero Trust access and inspection on endpoints.
      A malicious insider may disable or bypass the client, allowing AI tools
      to operate outside inspection on unmanaged devices.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Shadow AI Agents</h2>

    <p>
      Shadow AI agents operate outside IT governance, often embedded in scripts,
      browser extensions, or automation tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Until detection reaches GA, these agents can bypass registration and deep auditing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Command-and-Control via AI Providers</h2>

    <p>
      Rogue agents may communicate with public LLM APIs over encrypted channels.
      Because AI providers are often whitelisted, sensitive data exfiltration
      becomes difficult to detect without behavioral analysis.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Network-Layer Prompt Injection</h2>

    <p>
      Prompt injection can occur in transit or through chained agent calls,
      causing agents to ignore intent or leak sensitive data.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">The Current Best Mitigation: Purview Insider Risk Management</h2>

    <p>
      Today, the strongest mitigation against insider-driven AI abuse is
      Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM).
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Behavioral detection beyond static rules</li>
      <li>Risk scoring across users and agents</li>
      <li>Unified investigations across Microsoft security tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Governance Gaps for the Second Line of Defense</h2>

    <p>
      Agent 365 primarily serves engineering and platform administrators.
      Governance teams still rely on Purview for audit and compliance,
      resulting in fragmented oversight.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Visibility Beyond Microsoft Remains Limited</h2>

    <p>
      Native controls struggle with third-party AI tools, non-Microsoft data sources,
      cross-cloud orchestration, and server-side AI processes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Licensing and Lock-In Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      Advanced AI governance requires E5 licensing, increasing cost pressure
      and vendor dependency if Microsoft becomes the sole AI registry.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Gartner’s Recommendation: Independent AI TRiSM</h2>

    <p>
      Gartner is explicit: no single vendor can enforce runtime control over AI agents
      once they cross platforms and environments.
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Define enterprise-wide AI policy</li>
      <li>Prioritize comprehensive AI discovery</li>
      <li>Adopt AI TRiSM guardian controls</li>
      <li>Avoid single-vendor dependency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">The Right Architecture: Augment, Don’t Replace</h2>

    <p>
      Agent 365 is a step in the right direction, but enterprise AI governance requires
      vendor-agnostic visibility, cross-cloud enforcement, and independent runtime controls.
    </p>

    <div class="closing">
      <p>
        <strong>Final Thought:</strong> Microsoft is building strong first-party controls for AI
        agents inside its ecosystem. But as AI expands beyond any single vendor,
        trust, risk, and security must be governed independently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Organizations that augment Purview and Agent 365 with independent AI TRiSM
        guardian layers will be best positioned to scale AI securely and with confidence.
