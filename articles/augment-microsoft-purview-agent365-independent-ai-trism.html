    <p>
      At Microsoft Ignite 2025, Microsoft made a decisive statement: AI agents are no longer
      experimental tools — they are enterprise actors that require identity, governance,
      and security controls.
    </p>

    <p>
      With major announcements across Agent 365, Entra Agent ID, expanded Microsoft Purview,
      and AI-assisted security operations, Microsoft is building a strong native control
      plane for AI agents embedded across Microsoft 365, Copilot, Fabric, and Foundry.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a meaningful and necessary evolution. However, as enterprises deploy AI across
      multiple clouds, data platforms, and third-party tools, a critical reality emerges:
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Native, vendor-scoped controls alone are not sufficient for enterprise-wide AI trust, risk, and security management.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">What Microsoft Got Right</h2>

    <h2 class="section-title">Agent 365: Centralized Oversight for AI Agents</h2>

    <p>
      Agent 365 introduces a centralized control plane designed to manage AI agents throughout
      their lifecycle. Agents are treated as digital employees, enabling:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Agent registration and inventory</li>
      <li>Lifecycle and access management</li>
      <li>Integration with Microsoft’s security stack (Entra, Defender, Purview, Sentinel)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Embedding governance directly into the same environment where agents are built is a
      strong architectural decision.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Entra Agent ID: Identity and Governance for Agents</h2>

    <p>
      Entra Agent ID extends Zero Trust identity concepts to AI agents by enabling:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Unique identities for agents</li>
      <li>Authentication and authorization</li>
      <li>Policy enforcement tied to identity posture</li>
      <li>Automated protections</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Identity is foundational — without it, governance cannot scale.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Expanded Microsoft Purview for AI</h2>

    <p>
      Microsoft Purview continues to be a core pillar of AI data governance, now offering:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Real-time DLP for Microsoft Copilot prompts and responses</li>
      <li>Heavy use of DSPM to understand data exposure and risk</li>
      <li>Integration with Insider Risk Management</li>
      <li>AI-assisted triage for faster investigations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Purview remains one of the strongest data-centric governance platforms available today.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Where the Gaps Remain</h2>

    <h2 class="section-title">Deep Protections Require Entra Registration</h2>

    <p>
      The most advanced auditing, enforcement, and automation capabilities are available only
      to agents registered with Entra Agent ID.
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Registration is opt-in</li>
      <li>Unregistered agents receive limited visibility</li>
      <li>Rogue or shadow agents may operate with reduced oversight</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This creates blind spots, particularly in large organizations with decentralized AI adoption.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Preventative Controls Remain in Preview</h2>

    <p>
      Several critical AI security controls remain in Preview, including:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Shadow AI agent detection</li>
      <li>TLS (encrypted traffic) inspection</li>
      <li>Network-layer prompt injection protection</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Until these reach GA, sophisticated insiders can still bypass controls.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Understanding Insider Threat Vectors</h2>

    <h2 class="section-title">Global Secure Access (GSA) Client</h2>

    <p>
      The Global Secure Access (GSA) client is Microsoft’s endpoint agent used to enforce
      Zero Trust access and inspection.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Risk:</strong> A malicious insider may disable or bypass the GSA client,
      allowing AI agents to operate outside inspection.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Shadow AI Agents</h2>

    <p>
      Shadow AI agents are agents or tools that:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Are not registered with IT or security teams</li>
      <li>Run in scripts, extensions, or SaaS platforms</li>
      <li>Operate outside governance workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Risk:</strong> Until shadow agent detection is GA, these agents may avoid deep auditing
      and policy enforcement.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Command-and-Control via AI Providers</h2>

    <p>
      Rogue agents may communicate with public LLM APIs over encrypted channels that are often
      implicitly trusted.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Risk:</strong> Sensitive data can be exfiltrated through TLS-encrypted AI traffic
      without advanced behavioral analysis.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Network-Layer Prompt Injection</h2>

    <p>
      Prompt manipulation in transit can cause agents to ignore intent, leak data,
      or perform unintended actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Risk:</strong> Network-layer prompt injection protection remains in Preview.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">The Current Best Mitigation: Insider Risk Management</h2>

    <p>
      Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) currently provides the strongest
      mitigation against insider-driven AI abuse.
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Behavioral detection beyond static rules</li>
      <li>Risk scoring across users and agents</li>
      <li>Unified investigations across Microsoft security tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      However, AI-agent-specific workflows are still evolving.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Governance Gaps for the Second Line of Defense</h2>

    <p>
      Agent 365 primarily serves engineering and platform administrators, while AI governance
      programs are often owned by risk, compliance, and GRC teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      This results in fragmented oversight and multiple admin centers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Visibility Beyond Microsoft Remains Limited</h2>

    <p>
      Native controls struggle with:
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Non-Microsoft data platforms</li>
      <li>Third-party AI tools</li>
      <li>Cross-cloud and server-side AI agents</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Licensing and Lock-In Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      Advanced AI governance capabilities often require E5 licensing, increasing cost
      and vendor dependency.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Gartner’s Recommendation: Adopt Independent AI TRiSM</h2>

    <p>
      Gartner is clear: no single cloud provider can enforce AI runtime control across
      all environments.
    </p>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Define enterprise-owned AI policy</li>
      <li>Discover all AI agents — sanctioned and shadow</li>
      <li>Adopt independent AI TRiSM guardian layers</li>
      <li>Avoid single-vendor dependency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">The Right Architecture: Augment, Don’t Replace</h2>

    <p>
      Agent 365 is a step in the right direction — but enterprise AI governance requires
      independent, cross-cloud AI TRiSM controls.
    </p>

    <div class="closing">
      <p>
        <strong>Final Thought:</strong> Microsoft is building strong first-party AI controls,
        but trust, risk, and security must be governed independently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enterprises that augment Purview and Agent 365 with independent AI TRiSM layers
        will be best positioned to scale AI securely, compliantly, and with confidence.
