        <p>
          Secure Service Edge (SSE) was built for a world where applications behaved predictably,
          users initiated actions explicitly, and data flows followed well-understood paths.
          That world no longer exists.
        </p>

        <p>
          As enterprises adopt generative AI, copilots, and autonomous agents, a new class of
          traffic patterns is emerging—patterns that traditional SSE architectures were never
          designed to observe, understand, or control.
        </p>

        <h2>The Original SSE Assumptions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Human users explicitly initiate requests</li>
          <li>Traffic targets known applications</li>
          <li>Application behavior is deterministic</li>
          <li>Data flows follow request–response models</li>
          <li>Policy enforcement occurs at network or application boundaries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The New Reality: AI-Native Traffic</h2>
        <p>
          AI introduces non-deterministic, multi-hop, and autonomous workflows where models
          generate queries, agents chain actions, tools invoke APIs, and decisions are made
          without explicit human approval.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 1: Prompt-Initiated Data Retrieval</h2>
        <p>
          In AI workflows, a prompt becomes the trigger for data access. Traditional SSE sees
          legitimate SaaS or API traffic, but lacks awareness of prompt intent, justification,
          or downstream data exposure.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 2: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Traffic</h2>
        <p>
          Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces a new execution plane where models invoke tools,
          datasets, and APIs. Enforcement must occur between the model and internal systems—not
          just at the user boundary.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 3: Chained Tool Execution & Agent Loops</h2>
        <p>
          Autonomous agents plan, execute, and iterate, creating cumulative risk across multiple
          seemingly benign actions—something stateless SSE policies cannot detect.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 4: Non-Deterministic Responses</h2>
        <p>
          AI outputs are probabilistic. Identical prompts may produce different sensitivity
          levels, requiring runtime inspection and response-level governance.
        </p>

        <h2>Pattern 5: Shadow AI & Unsanctioned Models</h2>
        <p>
          Without AI-specific detection, SSE cannot reliably distinguish between approved
          copilots, personal AI accounts, or high-risk unsanctioned model usage.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <strong>Traditional SSE fails because it enforces access, not outcomes.</strong><br />
          AI demands intent-aware, behavior-level, and runtime security controls.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>What AI-Aware SSE Must Become</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Prompt and response inspection</li>
          <li>Model and agent action governance</li>
          <li>MCP-aware enforcement</li>
          <li>AI data lineage tracking</li>
          <li>Runtime guardrails for autonomous behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thought</h2>
        <p>
          AI traffic does not resemble traditional web or SaaS traffic. Enterprises that treat
          AI as “just another app” will struggle with visibility and trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those that evolve SSE to understand AI-native traffic patterns will unlock innovation
          without surrendering governance.
        </p>
