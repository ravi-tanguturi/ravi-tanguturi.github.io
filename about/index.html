  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Principal-level security architect focused on designing AI-ready,
    data-centric security architectures for modern enterprises.

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <div class="section highlight-box">
      <p>
        I am a Principal Security Architect with over 17 years of experience designing
        and delivering enterprise-scale security architectures across cloud, SaaS,
        and data-driven environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work sits at the intersection of AI security, data protection, and Zero Trust—helping
        organizations adopt emerging technologies like LLMs, copilots, and autonomous agents
        without compromising regulatory compliance, performance, or trust.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Professional Focus</h2>
      <p>
        I specialize in translating complex business, regulatory, and risk requirements into
        practical, scalable security architectures. This includes Secure Service Edge (SSE),
        Zero Trust, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Data Security Posture Management (DSPM),
        identity governance, and AI security guardrails.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve partnered closely with CISOs, CTOs, and senior engineering leaders
        across financial services, healthcare, telecom, and high-tech sectors—supporting
        organizations with tens of thousands of users operating across multi-cloud and global
        environments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>AI Security & Enterprise Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        As enterprises rapidly adopt generative AI, traditional perimeter-centric and SaaS-only
        security models are no longer sufficient. My recent work has focused on defining
        AI-ready security frameworks that extend Zero Trust and SSE principles into
        AI-driven workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        This includes governance models for LLM access, sensitive data inspection,
        prompt-level controls, model access policies, and integration with emerging
        industry standards such as NIST AI Risk Management Framework and OWASP LLM Top 10.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Leadership & Advisory Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond hands-on architecture, I regularly serve in an advisory capacity—leading
        executive workshops, architecture reviews, and strategic planning sessions for
        security leadership teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve supported large-scale security transformation initiatives, competitive platform
        evaluations, and high-stakes proof-of-value programs, often acting as the technical
        escalation point for complex or high-risk deployments.
      </p>

      <h2>Areas of Expertise</h2>
      <ul class="focus-list">
        <li>AI security governance for LLMs, copilots, and agentic systems</li>
        <li>Secure Service Edge (SSE) and Zero Trust architecture at enterprise scale</li>
        <li>Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and sensitive data visibility</li>
        <li>Cloud and SaaS security across AWS, Azure, and GCP</li>
        <li>Identity, access, and policy-driven security design</li>
        <li>Security architecture for regulated and global environments</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- SECTION 6 -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <p>
        This site is a collection of architecture notes, design patterns, and practical
        insights drawn from real-world deployments and advisory work. It is intended
        for security leaders, architects, and engineers navigating the shift toward
        AI-driven, data-centric enterprise environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The perspectives shared here evolve as the threat landscape, technology ecosystem,
        and regulatory expectations continue to change.
